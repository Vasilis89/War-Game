My games title is war. It is a card based game where the whole purpose is to rank cards against each other. If your card has a higher value than the opponent then you yake their card and your own and put it back into your deck. if you deal out a card with the same value you will each deal out three cards and go to "War". The third cards value will determine the winner. The objective of the game is to get all your opponents cards.
